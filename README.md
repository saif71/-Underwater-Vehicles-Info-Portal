Project Type: 
Blog - Information Portal
Project Title: 
Underwater Vehicles Information Portal by Saif71
Primary Content:
An information portal with detailed information and statistics about different types of underwater vehicles.  
Domain Name:
https://saif71.com/products/uwv/

Platform 
Frontend: HTML , CSS , JS 
Backend: PHP, 
Framework: SlimPHP

Why I choose this concept:
Underwater vehicles are one of the topics I’m very interested in personally. For a couple of months, I did some research and study. Now I want to share my knowledge and findings with the world by publishing these publicly. As I’ve already had sufficient knowledge about these types of vehicles, now I want to start a blog portal. 

User Benefits:
An autonomous underwater vehicle is a robot that travels underwater without requiring input from an operator. These vehicles are one of the wonderful scientific engineering marvels. But there is very little information available for public usage. Most of the information we could find is in the form of scientific research papers and data. Which aren’t suitable for the public interest. 
My goal is to bridge this gap. In this portal, users will get simplified pieces of information about different types of UWVs. 

Monetization: 
Though it's a hobby project, I’ve some plans about monetization. I’ve planned both short term and long term monetization plans. 

Short term:
By placing advertisements from Google Adsense, 
Ad choice, and 
Amazon Affiliate Ads. 
Long term :
Offering an ad-free version with a monthly subscription.
Offering premium articles with a monthly and one-time subscription. 
Target user group:

Researchers 
Hobbyist
Journalist
Marine Students
Marine Biologist
General users with a particular interest
System and functionality outline:
Blogging is more commonplace now than ever before. It’s estimated that there are at least 147 million blogs covering topics from technology to Japanese theme restaurants.

But regardless of the vastness of the blogosphere and the diversity of blog topics, there are a handful of site features that you’ll likely find in most of them. In addition, readers have come to expect these site features to be available to them when they visit my blog portal.
This section will cover the standard features of my blog. These features are meant to improve the user experience by enhancing community engagement, content sharing, findability of posts, and more.

Measuring project growth and analytics:
Blogging without measuring results is a complete waste of time. But when it comes to information blogs, there is a whole range of metrics we should consider. In fact, the number of blogging metrics can get so overwhelming that tracking them all wouldn’t leave much time for blogging, let alone other important aspects of inbound marketing. So I’ve made the most important metrics I need to keep an eye on to know how my blogging is going.
I will collect these metrics using Google Analytics and MixPanel.
